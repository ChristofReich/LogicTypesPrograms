# Logic, Types, and Programs

This is the Git ripository of the Meetup group "Logic, Types, and Programs". This group aims to connect people who are interested in formal logic and its various applications, such as software verification, formal mathematics, type systems, or philosophy. We will not restrict ourself to one application, but instead try to explore and learn in an open ended fashion. 

To create an inclusive and open space we ask you to follow the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org).
